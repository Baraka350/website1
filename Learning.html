        <h2>‚úîÔ∏èWhat is a Webpage?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>webpage</strong> is a single document that is part of a website. It can contain text, images, videos, links, and other multimedia elements that are displayed in a web browser. A webpage is accessed using a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).</p>
        <p>Think of a webpage like a single page of a book. It provides specific information, and you can navigate through other pages of the website by clicking on hyperlinks.</p>
        <h3>Characteristics of a Webpage:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Single document or page.</li>
            <li>Has its own URL or address.</li>
            <li>Part of a larger website.</li>
            <li>Contains content like text, images, and multimedia.</li>
            <li>Can be static or dynamic, depending on the design.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example of a Webpage:</h3>
        <p>Example URL: <a href="https://www.example.com/about-us">https://www.example.com/about-us</a></p>
        <p>This is the "About Us" page of the example website, which is just one of many pages within that site.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> ‚úîÔ∏èWhat is a Website?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>website</strong> is a collection of multiple webpages that are related and are hosted under the same domain name. A website can consist of many webpages like the homepage, contact page, about page, blog pages, etc. Websites serve as platforms for businesses, blogs, educational content, online shopping, and much more.</p>
        <p>Think of a website as a complete book, where each webpage is a page within that book, contributing to the overall theme or purpose of the website.</p>
        <h3>Characteristics of a Website:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Composed of multiple webpages.</li>
            <li>Hosted under a single domain name (e.g., www.example.com).</li>
            <li>Provides a range of information and services.</li>
            <li>Includes navigation to help users move between pages.</li>
            <li>May include both static and dynamic elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example of a Website:</h3>
        <p>Example URL: <a href="https://www.example.com">https://www.example.com</a></p>
        <p>The homepage of this website is just the main entry point, but there are many other pages that provide different types of content and services.</p>

        <h2>‚úîÔ∏èURL</h2>
        <p>A <strong>URL</strong>(Uniform Resource Locator) is an essential tool that enables users to access, interact with, and navigate the internet efficiently. It plays a crucial role in rendering web pages, ensuring security, and providing a seamless user experience. üöÄ.</p>
        <h3>Domain name</h3>
        <p>A domain name is the unique address of a website on the internet. It is what users type into a web browser to access a website instead of using an IP address.</p>
        <h3>Top Level Domain (TLD)</h3>
        <p>A Top-Level Domain (TLD) is the last part of a domain name, appearing after the final dot (.) in a URL. It represents the highest level in the domain name system (DNS) hierarchy and helps classify domain names based on their purpose, geographic location, or type.</p>
        
        <h3>Example of TLD :</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>.com ‚Äì Commercial websites</li>
            <li>.org ‚Äì Nonprofit organizations</li>
            <li>.edu ‚Äì Educational institutions</li>
            <li>.info ‚Äì Informational websites</li>
            <li>.tech ‚Äì Technology-related sites</li>
            <li>.uk ‚Äì United Kingdom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>https://www.google.com/index.html</p>
        <ul>
            <li>http: This is the protocol used for communication between the browser and the server. It stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, and in this case, it means that the connection is not encrypted. If the URL used https (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), it would indicate that the connection is encrypted.</li>
            <li>www: This is a subdomain of the main domain. It‚Äôs commonly used to identify websites on the internet, but it‚Äôs not strictly necessary. Many websites function just fine without the "www" prefix.</li>
            <li>google.com: This is the domain name of the website. The "google" part is the second-level domain (SLD), while ".com" is the Top-Level Domain (TLD).</li>
            <li>/index.html: This is the path to a specific resource on the server. In this case, index.html is typically the default file that a web server serves when no specific file is requested (e.g., when a user just types the domain name without a file extension). It is an HTML file, which is a standard web page format.</li>
            <li>www.google.com : resource name</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Hyper link</h2>
        <p>A <strong>hyperlink</strong> is a reference or navigation element in a document that links to another section of the same document or to another document. It is typically underlined and displayed in a different color to indicate that it is clickable.</p>
        <p>A hyperlink, commonly known as a link, is a reference or navigation element in a webpage that allows users to access another resource, such as another webpage, file, or section within the same document, by clicking on it.</p>
        <h2>The following are some characteristic of webpage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A webpage should be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
            <li>Navigation links, menus, and buttons allow users to move through the website and access other pages or sections.</li>
            <li>A webpage is structured using HTML (HyperText Markup Language), organizing content into different sections such as the header, body, and footer.</li>
            <li>The design of a webpage includes its layout, color scheme, fonts, and visual elements that contribute to the page‚Äôs overall aesthetic and user experience.</li>
            <li>Webpages contain different types of content, such as text, images, videos, links, and interactive elements.</li>
            <li>Some webpages include forms, buttons, and other interactive features, often powered by JavaScript, to allow users to interact with the content.</li>

        </table>
        <h2>How does webpage work?</h2>
        <p>When a user enters a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a web browser, the browser sends a request to a web server to retrieve the webpage associated with that URL. The web server processes the request and sends back the webpage data, which the browser then renders and displays to the user.</p>
        <p>Webpages are typically written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and may include other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. These technologies work together to create the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with on a webpage.</p>
        <p>Webpages can contain various types of content, such as text, images, videos, links, forms, and interactive elements. They are designed to provide information, engage users, and facilitate navigation within a website.</p>
        <img src="cap.PNG" alt="">
        <p>Request SSL: The client (web browser) initiates a connection to the server and requests a secure connection using SSL. This is often indicated by "https://" in the website's address.</p>
        <p>SSL Handshake: The client and server perform an "SSL handshake," where they exchange information to establish a secure, encrypted connection. This involves verifying each other's identities and agreeing on encryption methods.</p>
        <p>Response: The server sends back the requested website content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to the client. This data is encrypted using SSL, ensuring that it remains confidential during transmission.</p>
        <p>Web Server & DB Interaction (Optional): If the website requires dynamic content (e.g., a login page, a product catalog), the web server may interact with the database to retrieve or update information.</p>
        <p>Display: The client (web browser) decrypts the received data and displays the website to the user.</p>
        <h2>Types of webpage</h2>
        <p>There are several types of webpages, each serving a different purpose and catering to specific user needs. Some common types of webpages include:</p>
        <h3>Static Webpages</h3>
        <p>A static webpage is a webpage that displays the same content to every user. The content is fixed and doesn't change unless manually updated by the website developer. These pages are typically coded in HTML, and they don't involve any backend programming or databases.
            <p>characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Content Consistency: The content remains the same for all visitors and does not change unless the page is edited manually.</li>
                <li>Speed: Static pages load faster because they are simple and don‚Äôt require server-side processing.</li>
                <li>Easy to Develop: Static webpages are straightforward to develop using basic HTML and CSS, making them an excellent choice for small websites.</li>
                <li>No Interaction: These pages don't offer interactive features like user login, form submissions, or dynamic content.</li>
                <li>Limited Customization: Since they don't rely on databases or backend systems, static pages cannot provide personalized experiences or tailor content to the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Dynamic Webpages</h3>
        <p>A dynamic webpage is a webpage that displays different content to users based on their interactions or preferences. These pages are typically generated on the server-side using programming languages like PHP, Python, or JavaScript. Dynamic webpages can pull data from databases, process user input, and provide personalized content.</p>
            <p>characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Content Changes Based on User Interaction: The content on dynamic pages can change based on the time of day, user input, or other variables. For example, a social media feed updates with new posts based on the user's activity.</li>
                <li>nteractivity: Dynamic webpages support user interaction, such as form submissions, logins, comments, and personalized experiences.</li>
                <li>Requires Backend Technologies: To display dynamic content, these pages often rely on databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) and server-side technologies.</li>
                <li>Higher Server Load: Dynamic pages can be slower to load than static pages because they require processing on the server before being displayed to the user.</li>
                <li>User-Specific Content: They can display customized information depending on the user‚Äôs preferences, actions, or data.</li>
            </ul>
