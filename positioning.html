        <h1>Hand Positioning</h1>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Hand positioning refers to how the hands should be placed on a keyboard to ensure proper typing technique, reduce strain, and increase typing speed and accuracy. Correct hand positioning ensures that fingers remain on the "home row" and helps prevent injuries from repetitive motions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>

        <h2>Finger Names and Positioning</h2>
        <p>The fingers of both hands are assigned specific roles while typing to maintain a comfortable and efficient posture. The following table outlines the names of the fingers for both the left and right hands:</p>

        <table>

            <h1>Body Posture for Typing</h1>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Body posture refers to the way your body is positioned while typing. Proper body posture while sitting at a desk or computer not only helps in increasing typing speed but also reduces the risk of strain or injury, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or neck pain.</p>
    
            <h2>Proper Body Posture Guidelines:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Back Support:</strong> Sit back in your chair with your back supported by the chair's backrest. Your back should be straight and upright to avoid slouching.</li>
                <li><strong>Feet Position:</strong> Keep your feet flat on the floor or on a footrest. Your knees should be at a 90-degree angle, and your thighs should be parallel to the ground.</li>
                <li><strong>Elbow Angle:</strong> Position your arms so that your elbows are at a 90-degree angle and close to your body. Your forearms should be parallel to the floor.</li>
                <li><strong>Wrist Position:</strong> Keep your wrists straight and avoid bending them up or down while typing. Ideally, your wrists should float above the keyboard, and not rest on the desk or the keyboard itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Screen Height:</strong> The top of your monitor should be at or just below eye level. You should be able to view the screen without tilting your head up or down.</li>
                <li><strong>Chair Height:</strong> Adjust your chair so that your feet are flat on the floor, and your thighs are parallel to the ground. This prevents straining your legs or back.</li>
                <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Ensure proper lighting that prevents glare on your screen. This can reduce eye strain and help maintain good posture as you focus more comfortably on the screen.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Benefits of Proper Body Posture:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduces the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSI).</li>
                <li>Improves typing speed and accuracy by providing a comfortable position.</li>
                <li>Decreases neck and back pain.</li>
                <li>Increases overall comfort and productivity during long typing sessions.</li>

            </ul>
              <h1>Ergonomics Definition</h1>
            <p><strong>Ergonomics</strong> is the scientific study of designing and arranging workspaces, tools, equipment, and tasks to fit the physical capabilities and limitations of people. The goal of ergonomics is to enhance comfort, efficiency, and safety by reducing the risk of injury, strain, and fatigue.</p>
            
            <p>In the context of computer use, ergonomics focuses on optimizing the design of the computer workstation, including chairs, desks, keyboards, and screens, to support healthy posture and reduce physical stress during prolonged use.</p>
            
            <p>Proper ergonomics helps prevent injuries like repetitive strain injuries (RSIs), back and neck pain, eye strain, and other musculoskeletal disorders, ensuring that people can work comfortably and efficiently.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>1. Adjust Your Chair Correctly</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seat Height:</strong> Your feet should rest flat on the floor with your knees at a 90-degree angle. If your feet don’t reach the ground, use a footrest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Back Support:</strong> Ensure your lower back is supported, and your chair has good lumbar support to maintain the natural curve of your spine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Armrests:</strong> Adjust the armrests so your shoulders are relaxed, and your elbows form a 90-degree angle when typing.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
                <h2>2. Position Your Desk and Monitor Properly</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Desk Height:</strong> Your desk should be at a height where your elbows are at a 90-degree angle when your hands are resting on the keyboard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitor Placement:</strong> The top of your screen should be at or slightly below eye level, about 20–30 inches away from your eyes. This prevents neck and eye strain.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Your keyboard should be at a height that allows your wrists to stay straight while typing. Avoid bending your wrists upward or downward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mouse:</strong> The mouse should be positioned close to the keyboard to prevent excessive reaching. Your wrist should remain straight, and your elbow should stay close to your body.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
                <h2>4. Maintain Proper Posture</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sit Up Straight:</strong> Avoid slouching. Your back should be aligned with the chair’s backrest, and your shoulders should be relaxed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feet Flat:</strong> Keep your feet flat on the floor or on a footrest, with your knees at a 90-degree angle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Crossing Legs:</strong> Crossing legs can cause discomfort and misalignment of your spine.</li>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>5. Take Frequent Breaks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rest Periods:</strong> Stand up, stretch, and walk around every 20–30 minutes. This improves circulation, reduces fatigue, and prevents repetitive strain injuries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stretching:</strong> Perform stretches for your neck, shoulders, wrists, and legs to relieve tension from sitting for long periods.</li>
